<h1>Welcome to Alejandro's first Boards webpage.</h1>
<H3>I appreciate you taking the time to come check it out.</H3>

<p>This is a short introduction of myself. Prior to attending this school,
    I actually worked on unmanned air systems. Before that, I was a United States soldier.
    So I'm excited to learn all I can.</p><br>
    
    <p>My objectives while I attend this school are as follows:<br>
        <br>
        <br>1. Design and complete robotic and embedded systems solutions that address real-world
         situations and challenges

        <br>2. Demonstrate embedded microprocessor system skills such as microcontroller selection, digital logic design, schematic
        creation, printed circuit board layout and construction, electromagnetic 
        compatibility design and manufacturing design.
